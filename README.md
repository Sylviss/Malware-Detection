# Malware-Detection
This project aims to correctly detect malware from a set of PE files.
# Installation & running guide:
## Prerequisites:
This project assumes Python 3.11 was used. Used package:
- sklearn
- pefile
- torch
- ...
All of the used package are stored in the requirement.txt file.
## Installation guide:
- Install the zip file and extract to a folder
- Open CMD in the main folder, which should be the malware-detection folder. Your current location should look like this:
```bash
C:\abcxyz\...\Malware-Detection>
```
## Running guide:
- For the UI version: run the command:
```bash
python src/ui.py
```
After that, the UI should look like this:
![alt text](readmeImage/image.png)
Choose a model to run in the middle part, and then choose one of the two type: a single file or directories. After that, any relevant data should be print out in the UI. For example:
![alt text](readmeImage/image234.png)
- For the ipynb verion: run the notebook run-model, located in src. The instruction are saved there, please read and follow it.
## Folder structure:
- Datasets: contains the dataset:
    + CLaMP_Raw: the unprocessed dataset
    + CLaMP_Integrated: the processed dataset
    + CLaMP_In_Selected: the processed dataset, after applying feature selection
- old: old files
- src:
    + images: many images contains experiments on the models,mostly consist of graph when doing validating models
    + models: the saved models in joblib or pickle form
    + notebooks: mostly consist of notebooks that we used to test the models. The result are saved there to save time for the users. Also contains some .py file of neural networks, that are used to help with loading models.
+ self: many notebook/files for testing, mostly redundant for checking.
+ tools: the tools that are used, mostly for converting input from raw file and process the dataset.
## Sidenote:
- When inputing any files to test for the data, beware of many exception that depend on your own computer, for example "Access denied". We have catch every exception that we found, but maybe there can be some uncatched one. In that case, just test on others files, best be your own files and not the system's
- When reading many of the notebook, you may catch glimpse of some data related to multiclass classification. We have tried to do that, but as the data and result are grim, we decide to stop doing multiclass classification. There may be some unremoved note on that, please ignore it.
